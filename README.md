Projects included
=================

1. **tic-tac-toe** A very simple but 100% functional tic-tac-toe multiplatform game. It works in all Pascal versions since Turbo Pascal 3.0 CP/M80 (1983) to modern [FreePascal](https://www.freepascal.org).
1. **cmdlnpas** cmdlnpas is acronym tentative for Command Line 3D FPS, that is a Pascal implementation of the same project written in C++ by javidx9 at GitHub repository https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS (video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw)
This is a multi-platform, multi-compiler and multi-computer-generation project because it runs on PC (Delphi, FreePascal, Turbo Pascal) and MSX computers (Borland Turbo Pascal 3.0 and MSXCompo Turbo Pascal 3.3f).
